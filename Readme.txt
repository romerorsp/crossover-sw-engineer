Unfortunately I could not finish the front end due to an article I'm writing a paper to the Brazilian Java Magazine.
You will notice that I've mande all the backend work, but the front is missing the templates and requests.
Also, I could not record the Video, due the same problem (the paper).
Hopefully you can check the work I've done through the JUnit Tests.
